Azure Pipeline Integration with Database Key Management
Description
This project automates the process of retrieving keys from a SQL Server database, using those keys to authenticate with Azure APIs, and triggering Azure pipelines based on the found keys. The script supports both single key and multiple key scenarios, using a loop to iterate through the keys and execute the required Azure pipeline.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools and services set up:

Visual Studio (for development and running the project).
SQL Server:
A SQL Server database containing the keys.
Appropriate permissions to read from the database.
Azure DevOps:
An Azure DevOps organization with at least one Azure pipeline configured.
Access to the pipeline APIs and credentials to trigger pipelines.
